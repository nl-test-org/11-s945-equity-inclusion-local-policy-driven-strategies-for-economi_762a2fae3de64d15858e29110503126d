Course Description & Objectives
-------------------------------

This course explores equity as a key value, measure, and framework for operationalizing local economic development plans and policies. The course examines theory as well as the implementation of local policy initiatives for equity in U.S. cities. Investigating a wide range of contemporary theory and practice in the field of urban economic development, students will propose new recommendations and executive strategies for cities currently pursuing pro-growth agendas. From contracting and municipal procurement to arts and culture-driven approaches, the course will provide students with 1) a working knowledge of local government approaches to more equitable economic development strategies; 2) a critical point of view on the merits and limitations of these strategies; 3) formal opportunities to present new views to public and political actors in the field.

Course Requirements and Grading
-------------------------------

Coursework includes authoring a policy brief for a senior official in a mayoral administration, a short essay (500-600 words) written as an op-ed, one team-based presentation analyzing a preselected city case study, and weekly reading reflection posts. Student-led presentations (10–15 minutes) will precede several class discussions. Students will also design a public roundtable for local organizers and advocates pursuing economic equity agendas in greater Boston.
